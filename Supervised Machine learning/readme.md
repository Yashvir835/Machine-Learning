# Supervised Machine learning

In supervised Machine learning a model learns from the already defined question and answers. Imagine you are given a set of x questions which map to a set of y answers, Here the model will be able to determine some sort of relationship between the input and the output.

`input x -> output y`

**It learns from being given right answers**

Here the desired outputs are called `lables`. The goal of the system is to `generalize` its response to act correctly in situation not present in the training set.

Some common implementation of Supervised machine learning are:

1. Classification: Predict a class or category
2. Regression : Predicting a numerical value

Some common Supervised Machine learning algorithms are:

1. k-Nearest Neighbours
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic regression
4. Support Vector Machines
5. Desicion Trees and Random Forests
6. Neural networks(Including Multilayer Preceptrons or MLPs)


# Challenges

- Time consuming and costly process of labeling data especially for complex problems that require millions of example
- Overfit the traning data, meaning they perform well on data they trained on but fail to generalize to new, unseen instances
